CSE190 programming assignment 2

1. Find persons who served as both actor and director in the same movie (display 
person name and movie title).

	MATCH (actor:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(movie:Movie)<-[:DIRECTED]-(director:Person)
	WHERE actor.name = director.name
	RETURN actor.name, movie.title

2. Find the name of directors who have never acted.
	
	MATCH (n: Person) -[:DIRECTED] -> (movie:Movie)
            WHERE NOT (n)-[:ACTED_IN]->(:Movie)
            RETURN DISTINCT n.name

3. For each person who has acted in at least one movie, add a label “Actor” to the node representing this person.

            MATCH (actor:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(movie:Movie)
            SET actor: Actor

4. For each actor, add a “roleCount” attribute containing the number of roles the actor has interpreted overall.

	MATCH (actor: Person) - [r:ACTED_IN] -> (movie: Movie)
	WITH actor, count(r) as n
            SET actor.roleCount = n

5. For each director, find the number of roles they have directed (display director name and role number).

	MATCH (actor: Person) - [r:ACTED_IN] -> (movie: Movie) <- [:DIRECTED] - (director:Person)
            RETURN director.name, count(r.roles) AS roleNumber

6. Find the name of actors who have worked with every director born after 1966.

MATCH (a:Person)-[:DIRECTED]->(movie:Movie)
WHERE a.born>1966
SET a.selected = TRUE
WITH count(distinct a) as num
MATCH (a:Person) - [:ACTED_IN] -> (movie:Movie) <-[:DIRECTED]-(p:Person{selected:TRUE})
WITH a, count(distinct p) as n, num as num
SET a.count = n
WITH num as num
MATCH (a:Person{count:num})
WITH a.name as name
MATCH (p:Person)
REMOVE p.selected,p.count
RETURN distinct name

7. Rename each ACTED_IN relation to APPEARED_IN, preserve the “roles” attribute.

	MATCH (actor: Person) - [r:ACTED_IN] -> (movie: Movie)
	CREATE (actor) - [x:APPEARED_IN {roles:r.roles}] -> (movie:Movie)
	DELETE r
